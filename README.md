# **Odin-recipes**

A simple recipe website to showcase a few of my favorite dishes.

## **Reflection**

Through the completion of this project, I have gained an understanding of fundamental HTML concepts. I have learned how to create the boilerplate for an HTML page, work with unordered and ordered lists, create links between web pages, and lay out text and images on those pages, too. Furthermore, I have learned the basics of the Git workflow, the importance of atomic commits, and the value of good commit messages. These lessons will be invaluable to me as I continue down the path of web development.
